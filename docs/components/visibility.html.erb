    <h4>Screen Size Visibility Control (Show)</h4>
    <p>The following text should describe the device you're using:</p>
    <p class="panel">
      <strong class="show-for-small">You are on a small screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-medium">You are on a medium screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-medium-up">You are on a medium or larger screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-medium-down">You are on a medium or smaller screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-large">You are on a large screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-large-up">You are on a large or bigger screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-large-down">You are on a large or smaller screen.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-xlarge">You are on a xlarge screen.</strong>
    </p>

    <h4>Screen Size Visibility Control (Hide)</h4>
    <p>The following text should describe the device you're using:</p>
    <p class="panel">
      <strong class="hide-for-small">You are not on a small screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-medium">You are not on a medium screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-medium-up">You are not on a medium or larger screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-medium-down">You are not on a medium or smaller screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-large">You are not on a large screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-large-up">You are not on a large or bigger screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-large-down">You are not on a large or smaller screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-xlarge">You are not on a xlarge screen.</strong>
    </p>

   <!--  <br>
    <p>This example uses the opposite rules, so the following text should inversely describe the device you're using:
      <strong class="hide-for-xlarge">You are not on a very large screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-large">You are not on a large screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-large-up">You are not on a large or very large screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-medium-down">You are not on a medium or small screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-medium">You are not on a medium screen.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-small">You are not on a small screen.</strong>
    </p>

    <h5>Orientation Detection</h5>
    <p>The following text should describe the device you're using:
      <strong class="show-for-landscape">You are in landscape orientation.</strong>
      <strong class="show-for-portrait">You are in portrait orientation.</strong>
    </p>

    <h5>Touch Detection</h5>
    <p>The following text should describe the device you're using:
      <strong class="show-for-touch">You are on a touch-enabled device.</strong>
      <strong class="hide-for-touch">You are not on a touch-enabled device.</strong>
    </p>

    <h5>Media Query Viewer</h5>
    <p>Easily add the ability to show which media query you are currently viewing. To activate the viewer, make sure you have <strong>jquery.foundation.mediaQueryToggle.js</strong> linked up on your page. From there, simply add the markup to your page or press <kbd>M</kbd>. The keyboard toggle won't work on mobile devices so make sure you add the markup in those cases.</p> -->
