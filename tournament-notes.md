# Before emailing staff with instructions
* Make sure they all have accounts
* Update web/instructions/index.jsp if necessary (at least update the year in the menu)

# Before the tournament
* Make sure cards that end 5–2 or better have final messages about the championship match. Maybe we want to do this for all cards (e.g., to advertise the awards ceremony).
* Check "Online Stats?" on the tournament-edit page.
* Back up the database.
* Run the database maintenance "queries".
* Restart the server early the morning of the tournament so that the cached menu updates for today.


# At the tournament
* Make sure there are printed copies of all questions in the control room
* Make sure a buzzer system is available and set up for the championship match in advance (and that it can be kept until the finals end)
* Make sure there's a printed copy of the championship-match questions for buzzpoint tracking
* Make sure notes are kept at the award ceremony on which category winners did not pick up their ribbon


# After the tournament
* Restart the server the day after the tournament so that the cached menu updates.
* Archive messages so they won't still show up next year.
* Back up the database.
* Run the database maintenance "queries".
