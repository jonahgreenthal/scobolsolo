```scss
/* Mixin and configurable options */
.your-class-name {
  @include block-grid($per-row, $spacing, $base-styles);
}

/* This controls how many elements will be on each row of the block grid. */
/* Set this to whatever number you need, up to the max allowed in the variable */
$per-row: false;

/* This controls how much space is between each item in the block grid */
$spacing: $block-grid-default-spacing;

/* This controls whether or not base styles come through, set to false to leave out */
