      <h3>Bower Components</h3> 
    </div>
    <ul class="info-list">
      <li>The recommended install uses Bower to package up all the Foundation components and manage any updates. Any changes made to files in this folder will be overwritten when your file is compiled.</li>
      <li><strong>fastclick.js</strong><br>We’ve integrated fastclick.js so you have the option to give your mobile users have a snappier experience.</li>
      <li><strong>foundation folder</strong><br>This is where we keep all the files that make foundation work. Any CSS and SCSS partials and javascript live here. Including the components here allows you to easily update your project with ```bower update``` command.</li>
      <li><strong>jquery</strong><br> We've included jQuery 2.0 in here because anytime there is an update to jQuery with a Foundation release it will be updated as well.</li>
      <li><strong>jquery.cookie</strong><br>This is included in Foundation for our Joyride feature. It allows the browser to create a cookie specifically for the option to not show the Joyride tour a second time.</li>
      <li><strong>modernizr</strong><br>This acts as a shim for HTML5 elements that older browsers may not recognize, and provides detection for mobile devices:</li>
      <li><strong>normalize.scss</strong><br>We've included a copy of Normalize here to give you the option to remove quirks in browsers so that all webpages render elements consistently.</li>

      <h3>Pre-Packaged Essentials</h3> 
    </div>
    <ul class="info-list">
      <li><strong>index.html</strong><br>This is an example index file which contains some sample markup (the grid, buttons, etc) as well as the basic structure of a responsive Foundation page. Feel free to change or destroy this file as you see fit, just bear in mind that some of the document ```<head>``` is required for the page to work, and the CSS/JS is linked up at the end of the document.</li>
      <li><strong>humans.txt</strong><br>A basic humans.txt file you can use as a basis for your site, if you'd like to have a humans.txt file</li>
      <li><strong>robots.txt</strong><br>Another basic starter file, this is a sample robot file you can amend and modify to suit your particular crawling needs.</li>
      <li><strong>bower.json</strong><br>During updates, this the file you can specify what version to update to.</li>
      <li><strong>config.rb</strong><br>This is where Ruby is told what assets to assemble and how to map your project's file locations.</li>

    <h2>HTML Page Markup</h2>
    <p>As you'll see in our ```index.html``` sample, Foundation pages have some specific markup required for them to work. This code block is a simple boilerplate for content-free Foundation pages that we hope comes in handy.</p>
