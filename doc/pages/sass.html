## Getting Started with Sass

<h3 class="subheader">Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features like variables, nested selectors, loops. It's also the easiest way to customize Foundation!</h3>

### System Requirements

Before proceeding, you'll want to install the following on your system:

  * Git
  * [Ruby 1.9+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

Starting in Foundation 5 we've started using bower to manage the updating process of Foundation. It only needs to be installed one time using the following command:

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g bower
```

Then you can install our CLI using the following command:

```bash
gem install foundation-cli --pre
```

### Using Foundation with Compass

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is the easiest way to get going with Sass. It can be installed with the following commands:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>New Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
foundation new MY_PROJECT
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

---

### Using Foundation with Grunt + Libsass

Using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) in conjunction with [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass) is the fasted way to compile your Sass stylesheets.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>New Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
foundation new MY_PROJECT --libsass
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>
