<h3 class="subheader">Sass is the easiest way to customize Foundation! It is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features such as variables, nested selectors and loops. </h3>

    SCSS is a great way to speed up front-end development. SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax was introduced as "the new main syntax" for Sass and builds on the existing syntax of CSS. We created a SCSS version to allow more friendly and dynamic styling, but they also offer greater customization in the SCSS version than in the HTML/CSS version

    We created this command line interface (CLI) to make creating a Foundation project and updating your project. Using this CLI will greatly speed up your workflow as it does many tasks for you. When updating the CLI updates your project while leaving your customized styles in tact. This is the recommended way to start.

Starting in Foundation 5, we've started using Bower to manage the updating process of Foundation. It only needs to be installed one time using the following command:

<h4>Bash</h4>

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

Then you can install our CLI using the following command:

<h4>Bash</h4>

```bash
gem install foundation
```

### Using Foundation With Grunt + Libsass

At ZURB, we prefer to run Foundation with using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) in conjunction with [Libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass), because it's the fastest way to compile your Sass stylesheets.

###### Create a New Project

First, navigate into the directory where you want to create your project.

```bash
cd path/to/sites
```

Next we'll use the Foundation CLI to create a new project:

```bash
foundation new project_name --libsass
```

Boom, your project is created! Now you need to use Grunt to compile everything before you start working:

```bash
cd project_name
grunt build
```

  <div class="large-12 columns">

    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

***

### Using Foundation With Compass

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is the easiest way to get going with Sass. If you do not already have installed here it can be installed with the following command:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-12 columns">
{{#markdown}}
```bash
gem install compass
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>New Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
foundation new MY_PROJECT
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Updating Your Project</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
foundation update
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

### Using Foundation with something else

If you prefer using Foundation with a tool that's not listed here, you may want to check out our [community](/develop/tools.html) page to see if there's a port for you.
