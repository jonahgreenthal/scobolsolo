# Abide

#### Abide is an HTML5 form validation library that supports the native API by using patterns and required attributes.

{{> examples_abide_basic}}

***

### Setting up validation

To enable validation with Abide add the `data-abide` attribute to your `<form>` element. Then add the `required` attribute to each input that you want to require. Additionaly, you can define a `pattern` to define restraints on what users can input.

{{> examples_abide_basic_rendered}}

***

### Predefined patterns

Abide has several patterns common validation patterns built into the library:

{{> examples_abide_patterns}}

You can also use these patterns by settings the input's type to the name of the pattern instead of using the pattern attribute:

{{#markdown}}
```html
<input type="password" required>
<input type="email">
<input type="url">
```
{{/markdown}}

There is a good list of valid HTML5 input types on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input). Try to avoid using patterns defined by type that do not match the specification.

For named patterns that are not valid input types you can use the following shortcut:

{{#markdown}}
```html
<input type="text" pattern="integer">
```
{{/markdown}}

***

### Custom named patterns

By overriding Abide during Foundation initilization, you can define your own custom patterns or override the default patterns to validate against.

{{> examples_abide_custom_patterns}}

You can then use these custom patterns like you would the predfined patterns in your markup:

{{> examples_abide_custom_patterns_rendered}}

***

### Error Messages

To display an error message for your invalid form element include a `<small>` tag with an `error` class as a sibling of your input.

{{> examples_abide_errors}}

In the above example we have wrapped our input in a `div`. This div will receive an `error` class when the input is invalid. This class will show our error message and style the label and input accordingly.

Invalid inputs inherit a `data-invalid` attribute.

***

### Events

If a submit event is fired, a `valid` event is triggered if the form is valid and an `invalid` event is triggered if the form is invalid.

You can bind to these events and fire your own callback:

{{> examples_abide_events}}

***

### Using the JavaScript

<div class="panel">
  {{!-- TODO FIX JAVASCRIPT PATH --}}
  Before you can use Abide you'll want to verify that jQuery and `foundation.js` are available on your page. You can refer to the [javascript documentation](../javascript.html) on setting that up.
</div>

Just add `foundation.abide.js` AFTER the `foundation.js` file. Your markup should look something like this:

{{> examples_javascript}}

Required Foundation Library: `foundation.abide.js`

##### Optional JavaScript Configuration
