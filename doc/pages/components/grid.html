# Grid

<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the 12-column, nestable Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Start by adding an element with a class of `row`, forming your block element. Then add divs with a `columns` class within that row with and specify the widths of those inline elements with the `small-#`, `medium-#`, and `large-#` classes.

* **Foundation uses border-box**: Borders and padding do not affect the overall width of the columns, making the math dead-simple. 
* **Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can infinitely nest the grid, though at a certain point it will get absurd.

##### Offsets

Offset up to 11 by using classes like `.large-offset-1` and `.small-offset-3`.

##### Centered Columns

Center your columns by adding a class of `small-centered` to your `column`. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center on large only by applying a `large-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens use `large-uncentered`.

##### Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means you can have a sub-nav on the left on large displays, but go below on small ones. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. `small-pull-#`, `medium-push-#`, `large-push-#` is the syntax you'll use.

##### Medium Grid

The small and large grids give you control over mobile and desktop styles. A medium grid now offers greater flexibility and control to create complex layouts for tablets as well.

## Customize with Sass

The grid can be easily customized with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{> examples_grid_variables.scss}}


<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `grid-row()` mixin to create your own row with semantic markup, like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin.scss}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin}}
  </div>
</div>
