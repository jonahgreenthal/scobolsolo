# Grid

<h3 class="subheader">Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the 12-column, nestable Foundation grid. If you're familiar with grid systems, you'll feel right at home. If not, you'll learn quickly.</h3>

***

### Basic

* **Foundation uses border-box**: Borders and padding do not affect the overall width of the columns, making the math dead-simple. 
* **Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

### Advanced

You can infinitely nest the grid, though at a certain point it will get absurd.

##### Offsets

Offset up to 11 by using classes like `.large-offset-1` and `.small-offset-3`.

***

##### Centered Columns

Center your columns by adding a class of `small-centered` to your `column`. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center on large only by applying a `large-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens use `large-uncentered`.

##### Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means you can have a sub-nav on the left on large displays, but go below on small ones. <code>.push-#</code> is the syntax you'll use.

#### Small Grid

<!-- TODO FIX LINKS -->
As you've probably noticed in the examples above, you have access to a small and large grid. If you know that your grid structure will be the same for small devices as it will be on large devices, just use the small grid. You can override your small grid classes by adding large grid classes to it. To use the mixin, you'll need to have the <a href="../sass.html">extension installed</a> or grab <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/tree/master/scss/foundation/components">_variables.scss</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_global.scss">_global.scss</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/tree/master/scss/foundation/components">_grid.scss</a> from Github and throw them into a Foundation folder in your project directory.

#### Medium Grid

The small and large grids give you control over mobile and desktop styles. A medium grid now offers greater flexibility and control to create complex layouts for tablets as well.

#### Building With Mixins

If you are keen on SCSS and use it for your Foundation projects, you have access to grid mixins that will let you layout the page without using presentational classes that you don't want. You can create your own set of classes or even create your own grid. Setting any of the options to 'false' will leave off those styles, giving you lots of control over your CSS output. Here's an example structure you might use with the grid mixin:

***

### Grid-row Mixin

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
### Code Example
```scss
{{> examples_grid_row_mixin.scss}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h3>Options</h3>
{{> examples_grid_row_options}}
  </div>
</div>

### Grid-column Mixin

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
### Code Example
```scss
{{> examples_grid_column_mixin.scss}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h3>Options</h3>
    {{> examples_grid_column_options}}
  </div>
</div>

### Real World Example

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
### SCSS
```scss
#masthead { @include grid-row; @include panel;
  & > hgroup { @include grid-column(4); }
  & > section { @include grid-column(8); }
}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>

  <div class="large-6 columns">
{{#markdown}}
### HTML
```html
<header id="masthead">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>Title</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <section>
    <p>Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </section>
</header>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>

### Example

<header id="masthead">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>Title</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <section>
    <p>Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </section>
</header>
