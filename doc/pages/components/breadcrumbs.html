# Breadcrumbs

<h3 class="subheader">Breadcrumbs come in handy to show a navigation trail for users clicking through a site or app. They'll conform to 100% of the container width you put them in.</h3>

{{> examples_breadcrumbs_basic}}

***

### Basic

Add a class of `.breadcrumbs` to a `ul` element. List items will automatically be styled, and you can add `.current` or `.unavailable` classes to list items to denote their state.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_breadcrumbs_basic_rendered}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_breadcrumbs_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

You can also add a `.breadcrumbs` class to a `nav` element containing anchor links to get the same result.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_breadcrumbs_basic_nav_rendered}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_breadcrumbs_basic_nav}}
  </div>
</div>

## Customize with Sass

Breadcrumbs can be easily customized using our provided Sass variables.

##### Semantic Markup with Sass

You apply block grid styles to semantic markup using Sass mixins.

You can build your breadcrumbs using our global mixin by including it on your custom class or ID in your stylesheet. The container mixin will create the necessary style for the `ul`. The global mixin looks like this:

{{> examples_breadcrumbs_mixin}}

{{> examples_breadcrumbs_container_mixin}}

##### Crumb Mixin

Use this mixin to apply the list item and link styles to items inside the breadcrumb container. You attach this mixin to the list items inside of your container.

{{> examples_breadcrumbs_crumb_mixin}}

##### Radius Mixin

We've also created a global radius mixin that you can use to add border-radius to any element you'd like.

{{> examples_breadcrumbs_radius_mixin}}


**Note:** `em-calc();` is a function we wrote to convert `px` to `em`.
