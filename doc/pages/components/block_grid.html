# Block Grid

<h3 class="subheader">Block grids give you a way to evenly split contents of a list within the grid. If you wanted to create a row of 5 images or paragraphs that need to stay evenly spaced no matter the screen size, the block grid is for you.</h3>

***

{{> examples_block_basic}}

***

### Basic

Use a simple `small-block-#` class to code up the block grid and specify the number of items in a row.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_block_basic_rendered}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_block_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

### Advanced

Use additional classes to specify different a different number of items in a row for each screen size. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_block_advanced_rendered}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_block_advanced}}
  </div></div>

If you use the `small-block-grid` only, the grid will keep its spacing and configuration no matter the screen size. If you use `large-block-grid` only, the list items will stack on top of each other for small devices. If you use both of those classes combined, you can control the configuration and layout separately for each breakpoint.  

***

### Customize with Sass

Block grids can be easily customized with the Sass variables provided in the `_settings.scss` file.

#### SCSS

{{> examples_block_variables.scss}}

## Semantic Markup with Sass

You apply block-grid styles to semantic markup using Sass mixins.

### Import Foundation

**This is included in your app.scss file by default.** This imports all Foundation components.

```scss
/* This is imported by default. */
@import "foundation";
```

### Basic

You can use the `block-grid(#)` mixin to create your own alert box, like so:

#### SCSS
{{> examples_block_mixin_basic.scss}}

#### HTML
{{> examples_block_mixin_basic}}

### Advanced

You can further customize your alert boxes using the provided options in the `block-grid()` mixin:

#### SCSS
{{> examples_block_mixin_options}}


##### Clearing Block Grid Rows

We have this built into the CSS, but you'll need to add a bit of code if you want your block grid to change layout between breakpoints. If you don't use this, it will inherit whatever you put in the smallest media query. This code looks for the <code>n+1</code> of the grid so that it clears properly. That code looks like this:

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.your-small-class-name > li {
  clear: none !important;
}
```
{{/markdown}}

**Note:** If you are using the same class across breakpoints, your mixin should override this and you won't need it. If you want to control the layout using different classes, use the above snippet.

##### Advanced

If you only want to use block-grids and you've commented out `@import "foundation"` then make sure to include the following in your `

#### SCSS

```scss
/* If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import the following file */
@import "foundation/components/block-grid";
```
