# Visibility Classes

<h3 class="subheader"> Visibility classes provide some easy utility classes that let you hide or show elements based on a few device characteristics like screen size or orientation. This can be useful to turn off elements not well-suited to a situation,a mong other things.</h3>

### Show By Screen Size

In this example we're using the <strong>show</strong> visibility classes to show certain strings based on the device you're currently viewing this page on. If a class conditions are met, the element will be shown; if not, it will be hidden.

### Hide By Screen Size

This example shows the opposite: we're using the <strong>hide</strong> visibility classes to state which elements we should hide based on the device you're viewing this on. If the conditions are not met, the element will be shown.

{{> examples_visibility_hide}}

### Orientation Detection

This is a very straightforward example, showing a string based on which orientation your screen is in. On mobile devices this will change when you rotate the device; on a desktop the orientation is almost always reported as landscape.

### Touch Detection

Finally, there are visibility classes to hide or show content based on whether a device supports touch (as determined by Normalizr).
