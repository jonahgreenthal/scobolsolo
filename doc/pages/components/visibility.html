# Visibility Classes

<h3 class="subheader"> Visibility classes let you hide or show elements based on device characteristics like screen size or orientation. This can be useful to turn off elements not well-suited to a situation, among other things.</h3>

### Show By Screen Size

This example uses the **show** visibility classes to show certain strings based on the device on which you're currently viewing this page. If a browser meets the class's conditions, the element will be shown; if not, it will be hidden.

### Hide By Screen Size

This example shows the opposite: We're using the **hide** visibility classes to state which elements should disappear based on the device's size or orientation you're viewing this on. Users will see elements on every browser **except** those that meet these conditions.

### Orientation Detection

This straightforward example shows how two strings of text determine whether or not an element is visible in different orientations. On mobile devices this will change when you rotate the device; on a desktop the orientation is almost always reported as landscape.

### Touch Detection

Finally, there are visibility classes to hide or show content based on whether a device supports touch (as determined by Normalizr).
