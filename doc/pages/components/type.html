# Typography

#### We're no longer depending on modular scale in the core of Foundation. We made an effort with this release to be dependancy free other than Sass. This way people can use whatever framework and gems they want on top of Foundation. We'll still use [Compass](http://compass-style.org).

This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool. Wrap `<strong>` around type to **make it bold!**. You can also you `<em>` to *italicize your words*.

### Blockquotes

Sometimes other people say smart things, and you may want to mention that through a blockquote callout. We've got you covered.

<blockquote>I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them. Maecenas faucibus mollis interdum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.<cite>Isaac Asimov</cite></blockquote>

### Print Styles

Foundation includes print styles developed by HTML5 Boilerplate to give you some basic print-specific styles. These are activated when you print through a media query. It includes:

* Clearing out backgrounds, box shadows, and text shadows
* Appending link URLs after the anchor text
* Bordering blockquotes and pre elements
* Page cleanup and window minimization

On top of that, Foundation includes a couple of simple classes you can use to control elements printing, or not printing. Simply attach `.print-only` to an element to only show when printing, and `.hide-on-print` to hide something when printing.

We've got a ton of variables for you to use to customize your typography.
