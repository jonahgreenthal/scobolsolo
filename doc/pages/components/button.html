# Buttons

Buttons are a convenient tool when it comes to more traditional actions. To that end, Foundation has a lot of easy to use button styles that you can customize or override to fit your needs.

### Basic

Using minimal markup you can create a button.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_buttons_basic_rendered}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_buttons_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

### Advanced

Additional classes can be added to your component to change its appearance.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_buttons_advanced_rendered}}
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
{{> examples_buttons_advanced}}
  </div>
</div>

## Semantic Markup with Sass

You can create your own buttons using our Sass mixins

### Basic

You can use the `button()` mixin like so:

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>SCSS</h4>
{{> examples_buttons_default_mixin}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
<a href="#" class="custom-button-class">...</a>
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
</div>



If you are using the mixins, you may include the styles on whatever class or ID you'd like, just make sure you follow our markup structure:

{{#markdown}}
```html
<a href="#" class="your-class-name">Button Text</a>
```
{{/markdown}}

##### Quick Mixin

You can quickly build an entire button using our global mixin by including it on your custom class or ID in your stylesheet. The global mixin will create the necessary style for the button. The global mixin looks like this:



There are also **six options** you can customize on the fly when writing this mixin. These controls things like: background color, border color, text color, size and state. Setting any of these options to **false** will negate those styles.

##### Base Mixin

You also have access to a few internal mixins that can create parts of the button as needed. The base mixin will create a button base that only include structural styles.

##### Size Mixin

The size mixin will let you control the padding, which adjusts text size. You can also choose whether the button is full-width or an input button.

##### Style Mixin

The last internal mixin you have access to for buttons is the style mixin. This will help you style background color, text, border and radius.

Inset Shadow, Border Radius &amp; Transition Mixin

Sometimes you want to add a nice fancy shine to the edge of your button. And sometimes you want to make that shine look like it gets depressed upon tap or click. We've got you covered with our quick inset shadow mixin. You can use our radius mixin to quickly apply rounded corners or a transition mixin to give the button a nice zero-fade.

**Note:** `em-calc();` is a function we wrote to convert `px` to `em`.
