# Interchange

<h3 class="subheader">Interchange uses media queries to dynamically load responsive content that is appropriate for a user's browser.</h3>

<img data-interchange="[{{assets}}/img/examples/space-small.jpg, (small)], [{{assets}}/img/examples/space-medium.jpg, (medium)], [{{assets}}/img/examples/space-large.jpg, (large)]">
<noscript><img src="{{assets}}/img/examples/space-default.jpg"></noscript>

***

### Using the Markup with Images

The Foundation Interchange component utilizes the `data-interchange` attribute for specifying your media queries and their respective images.

{{> examples_interchange_basic_rendered}}

Each rule passed to `data-interchange` is comma delimited and encapsulated in square brackets, and each argument within a rule is also comma delimited. The first parameter is the path to your image, and the second parameter is your media query, surrounded by parenthesis.

{{#markdown}}
```html
data-interchange="[image_path, (media query)], [image_path, (media query)]"
```
{{/markdown}}

The last rule that evaluates to true will be the image that gets loaded. Exluding the `src` attribute keeps the browser from making two requests for images.

If you want to support browsers with JavaScript disabled, we recommend setting your default image in a `<noscript>` tag so that these browsers will have a fallback:

```html
<img data-interchange="[/path/to/default.jpg, (default)], [/path/to/bigger-image.jpg, (large)]">
<noscript><img src="/path/to/default.jpg"></noscript>
```

***

### Interchange for Other Content

You are not restricted to using Interchange with just images. You can now, as of Foundation 5, load responsive content on any html element.

<div id="interchangeMarkup" data-interchange="[{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/examples/interchange/default.html'}}, (small)], [{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/examples/interchange/medium.html'}}, (medium)], [{{relative absolute 'dist/docs/examples/interchange/large.html'}}, (large)]">
  <div data-alert class="alert-box secondary radius">
    This is the default content.
    <a href="#" class="close">&times;</a>
  </div>
</div>

{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_interchange_markup}}
```
{{/markdown}}

***

### Using Retina Images

You can easily include retina images by using a pixel-density media query for that image. You can even combine multiple parameters in the media query if need be. The retina media query would look something like this, but you can also use dpi or other pixel densities as well:

{{> examples_interchange_retina}}

***

### Named Queries

Interchange has a few built-in shortcuts that correlate with our visibility classes.

{{> examples_interchange_queries}}

To use the named queries, just pass the name in where you would normally specify your query.

{{> examples_interchange_queries_rendered}}

***

### Custom Named Queries

Custom queries can be defined during initialization and are an easy way to make your queries more readable. You can also override the default queries in this way:

{{> examples_interchange_custom_queries}}

***

### Events

Interchange triggers a `replace` event when a rule evaluates to true and the content has been replaced. This can be useful when you want to change some styles on your page based on which content is loaded.

{{> examples_interchange_events}}

***

### Adding new Interchange content after page load

If you add new content after the page has been loaded, you will need to trigger a `reflow` by running one of the following:

{{> examples_interchange_images}}

***

### Using the JavaScript

<div class="panel">
  Before you can use Interchange you'll want to verify that jQuery and `foundation.js` are available on your page. You can refer to the [javascript documentation](../javascript.html) on setting that up.
</div>

Just add `foundation.interchange.js` AFTER the `foundation.js` file. Your markup should look something like this:

{{> examples_interchange_javascript}}

Required Foundation Library: `foundation.interchange.js`
