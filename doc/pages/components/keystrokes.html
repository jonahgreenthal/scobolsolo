# Keystrokes

<h3 class="subheader">If you have keyboard affordances, you might need to explain them. To that end, there's a simple keystroke character affordance in Foundation.

For example, to close your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>. Don't actually do it. There's more docs to read.</h3>

***

### Basic

#### HTML

{{#markdown}}
```html
<p>For example, to close your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd></p>
```
{{/markdown}}

***

## Customize with Sass

Keystrokes can easily be customized using our provided Sass variables

#### SCSS

***

## Semantic Markup with Sass

You can create your own keystrokes using our Sass mixins.

### Basic

You can use the `keystroke()` mixin to create your own keystroke style, like so:

#### SCSS

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/keystrokes";

.custom-keystroke-class {
  // You can set the background color of your keystrokes, which also effects text and border
  @include keystroke($bg:orange);
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<kbd class="custom-keystroke-class"></kbd>
```
{{/markdown}}
