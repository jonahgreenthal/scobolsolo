# Keystrokes

<h3 class="subheader">If you have keyboard affordances, you might need to explain them. To that end, there's a simple keystroke character affordance in Foundation.

For example, to close your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>. Don't actually do it. There's more docs to read.</h3>

<h3>Basic</h3>

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```html
<p>For example, to close your browser hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd></p>
```
{{/markdown}}

## Semantic Markup with Sass

You can create your own keystrokes using our Sass mixins.

<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `keystroke()` mixin to create your own keystroke style, like so:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/components/keystrokes";

.custom-keystroke-class {
  // You can set the background color of your keystrokes, which also effects text and border
  @include keystroke($bg:orange);
}
```

<h4>HTML</h4>

```html
<kbd class="custom-keystroke-class"></kbd>
```
{{/markdown}}

***

##### Sass Errors?

If the default "foundation" import was commented out, then make sure you import this file:

<h4>SCSS</h4>

```scss
@import "foundation/components/keystrokes";
```
