# Alert Boxes

#### Alerts are a handy element you can drop into a form or inline on a page to communicate success, warnings, failure or just information. They'll conform to 100% of the container width you put them in.

### How To Work With Alerts

There are two ways to build alerts. You can use our predefined HTML classes or use our crafted mixins. Building an alert using our predefined classes is super-easy, you only need a block-level element with a class of `.alert-box` (we usually use a `<div>`). You may also include an anchor with a class of `.close` to create a close box. Here are some examples:

### HTML

{{> examples_alert_basic_rendered}}

For these styles to come across, make sure you have the **default Foundation CSS package** or that you've selected **alerts from a custom package**. These should be linked up following our default [HTML page structure]({{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/getting_started.html'}}).

***

### Build with Mixins

We've included SCSS mixins used to style alert boxes. To use these mixins, you'll need to have the [extension installed]({{relative absolute 'dist/docs/components/sass.html'}}) or grab [_variables.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/_variables.scss), [_global.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_global.scss) and [_alert-boxes.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_alert-boxes.scss) from Github and throw them into a Foundation folder in your project directory. From there, you can import the files at the top of your own SCSS stylesheet, like so:

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/variables";
@import "foundation/components/global";
@import "foundation/components/alert-boxes";
```
{{/markdown}}

If you are using the mixins, you may include the styles on whatever class or ID you'd like, just make sure you follow our markup structure:

{{> examples_alert_mixin_rendered}}

## Configuring Alert Boxes

You can use this to quickly create alerts with a single mixin.

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>SCSS</h3>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
/* Using the default styles */
.your-class-name { @include alert(); }

/* Using the available options */
.your-class-name { @include alert($bg:#ff6c3c); }
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>Rendered HTML</h3>
{{> examples_alert_mixin}}
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Options</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h5 class="subheader">Options</h5>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
$bg: $primary-color
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h5 class="subheader">Description</h5>
    <dl>
      <dt>$bg</dt>
      <dd>Background of alert. Default: $primary-color</dd>
    </dl>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
{{#markdown}}
```scss
$radius: false
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <dl>
      <dt>$radius</dt>
      <dd>Radius of alert box. Default: false.</dd>
    </dl>
  </div>
</div>

## Base Mixin

We use this mixin to create a default alert base

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>SCSS</h3>
{{> examples_alert_base_mixin}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>Rendered HTML</h3>
    <div class="alert-base">This is the base mixin.</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Background Mixin

You can control the background, border and text styles for the alert using this mixin. We base the border and text style on the background color you choose using some sweet Sass logic.

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>SCSS</h3>
{{> examples_alert_background_mixin}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>Rendered HTML</h3>
    <div data-alert class="alert-background">This is base and bg mixins.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h5 class="subheader">Options</h5>
{{#markdown}}
```scss
$bg:$primary-color
```
{{/markdown}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h5 class="subheader">Description</h5>
    <dl>
      <dt>$bg</dt>
      <dd>The background of the alert. Default: $primary-color.</dd>
    </dl>
  </div>
</div>

## Close Box Mixin

We use this to create the close button.

<div class="row">
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>SCSS</h3>
{{> examples_alert_close_mixin}}
  </div>
  <div class="half-grid">
    <h3>Rendered HTML</h3>
    <div data-alert class="alert-background">
      This is base, bg and close mixins.
      <a href="" class="close">&times;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Default SCSS Variables

{{> examples_alert_variables}}

**Note:** `em-calc();` is a function we wrote to convert `px` to `em`.

***

## Using the JavaScript

You don't need ths JS to create alert boxes with Foundation. The only reason you'll need to include `foundation.alerts.js` is if you want to add the ability to close an alert.

<div class="panel">
  Before you can use the top bar you'll want to verify that both jQuery (or Zepto) and `foundation.js` are available on your page. You can refer to the [javascript documentation](../javascript.html) on setting that up.
</div>

Just add `foundation.alerts.js` AFTER the `foundation.js` file. Your markup should look something like this:

{{> examples_alert_javascript}}

Required Foundation Library: `foundation.alerts.js`

Then, you'll need to add a data-attribute to make the JS work properly on that element. That looks like:

{{> examples_alert_data_attributes}}
