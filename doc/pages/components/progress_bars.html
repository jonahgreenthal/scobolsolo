<h3 class="subheader">A simple way to add progress bars to your layouts. You only need two HTML elements to make them and they're easy to customize.</h3>

{{> examples_progress_bars}}

***

<h3>Basic</h3>

Using minimal markup you can create a progress bar.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{#markdown}}
```html
{{> examples_progress_bars_basic}}
```
{{/markdown}}

  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    {{> examples_progress_bars_basic}}
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

Additional classes can be added to your progress bar to change it's appearance.

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
{{> examples_progress_bars_advanced}}
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <h4>Rendered HTML</h4>
    <div class="progress large-9 success round">
      <span class="meter" style="width: 80%"></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Customize with Sass

Progress bars can be easily customized using our provided Sass variables.

## Semantic Markup with Sass

You can create your own progress bars using our Sass mixins.

<h3>Basic</h3>

You can use the `progress-container()` and `progress-meter()` mixin to create your own progress bars, like so:

##### Container Mixin

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-progress-container {
  @include progress-container();
}
```
{{/markdown}}

<h4>HTML</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```html
<div class="custom-progress-container"></div>
```
{{/markdown}}

##### Meter Mixin

<h4>SCSS</h4>

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.custom-progress-container { @include progress-container;
  & > span { @include progress-meter($bg); }
}
```
{{/markdown}}

<h3>Advanced</h3>

You can further customize your progress bars using the provided options in the `progress-bar()` mixin:

##### Adding Border Radius

We can add a border radius to our progress bar through our mixins

<h4>SCSS</h4>





### Build With Predefined HTML Classes

There are two ways to add progress bars labels in Foundation 5: with our predefined HTML classes or with our mixins. Building progress bars using our predefined classes is simple, you'll just need to write a `<div class="progress">` and inside of that a `<span class="meter">`. The meter is the element that you can set a width to, either inline or programmatically on your own accord. The simplest way to do this is to change the `style="width:%"` property on the meter, itself.

{{#markdown}}
```html
<div class="progress"><span class="meter"></span></div>
```
{{/markdown}}

<div class="progress"><span class="meter"></span></div>

The class options:

* The color classes include: `.secondary, .alert` or `.success`
* The radius classes include: `.radius` or `.round`
* You may also you the grid width classes: `.small-#` or `.large-#`

{{#markdown}}
```html
<div class="progress large-6 success round">
  <span class="meter" style="width: 40%"></span>
</div>
```
{{/markdown}}

For these styles to come across, make sure you have the default Foundation CSS package or that you've selected labels from a custom package. These should be linked up following our default [HTML page structure](../index.html).

***

### Build with our Mixins

We've included SCSS mixins used to style progress bars. To use the mixin, you'll need to have the [extension installed](../sass.html) or grab [_variables.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/_variables.scss), [_global.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_global.scss) and [_progress-bars.scss](https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_progress-bars.scss) from Github and throw them into a Foundation folder in your project directory. From there, you can import the files at the top of your own SCSS stylesheet, like so:

{{#markdown}}
```scss
@import "foundation/variables";
@import "foundation/components/global";
@import "foundation/components/progress-bars";
```
{{/markdown}}

##### Container Mixin

Progress bars are made from a container and a meter. The container element holds most of the styles that come across and holds the meter, itself. You can create progress bars by creating a `<div>` and giving it a unique class or ID, then applying the mixin styles to it.

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.your-class-name { @include progress-container; }
```
{{/markdown}}

<div class="progress"></div>

##### Meter Mixin

The next step is to include an element inside of your container that will be styled as the meter.

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.your-class-name { @include progress-container;
  & > span { @include progress-meter($bg); }
}

/* We can set the background color of the meter to a variable or any color value */
$bg: $primary-color;
```
{{/markdown}}

<div class="progress">
  <span class="meter"></span>
</div>

##### Adding Border Radius

Like we mentioned on a few of the other component pages, you have access to some global mixins that can add even more style to elements like this. Here's an example of using border radius:

{{#markdown}}
```scss
.your-class-name {
  @include progress-container;
  @include radius(6px);
  & > span {
    @include progress-meter(pink);
    @include radius(5px);
  }
}
```
{{/markdown}}

<div class="progress-custom">
  <span style="width:33%"></span>
</div>
